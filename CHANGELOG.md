- Immediate NACK handling, to handle retransmission of lost packets.

### Changed
- License is now GNU GPLv3.



## [1.0.0] - 2017-01-10

### Added
- new adaptive jitter buffer algorithm, with improved performance.

### Changed
- License is changed from LGPLv2 to GPLv2.



## [0.27.0] - 2016-06-01

### Changed

### Fixed
- SRTP initialization.

	
## [0.19.0] - 2012-02-17

## [0.18.0] - 2011-12-22

### Added
- SRTP media encryption


## [0.17.0] - 2011-05-??

### Added
- rtp_session_get_round_trip_propagation()

### Fixed
- RTCP support.


## [0.16.0] - 2010-05-10

### Added
- DSCP handling on Windows.
- Accessors to struct PayloadType.
- new payload type definitions.

### Changed
- update stun api to support new RFC.

## [0.15.0] - 2008-10-13

### Changed
- reduce number of memory allocation: !! attention here ABI/API change !!
		If you are using mp=rtp_session_recvm_with_ts(), the payload data is no more pointed by mp->b_cont->b_rptr.
		Instead you can use the following to skip the header:
			rtp_get_payload(mp,mp->b_rptr);

### Fixed
- telephone event presence detection bug.


## [0.14.3] - 2008-03-14

### Added
- new ortp_set_memory_functions() method.

### Changed
- jitter buffer simplification and improvements


## [0.14.0] - 2007-07-27

### Added
- Number of channels in PayloadType (interface changed !).
- srtp optional support (using libsrtp from http://srtp.sf.net)

### Changed
- optimisations.


## [0.13.1] - 2007-04-11

### Changed
- do not recv rtcp packets from rtp_session_sendm_with_ts() when session is not send-only.
